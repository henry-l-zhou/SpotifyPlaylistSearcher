all the kids are depressed,jeremy zucker," How long have you been smiling? It seems like it's been too long Some days I don't feel like trying So what the fuck are you on? Oh-woah-oh-oh   I think too much, we drink too much Falling in love like it's just nothing I want to know where do we go When nothing's wrong   'Cause all the kids are depressed Nothing ever makes sense I'm not feeling alright Staying up 'til sunrise And hoping shit is okay Pretending we know things I don't know what happened My natural reaction is that we're scared So I guess we're scared   No I can't really keep lying 'Cause I've been scared all along I'm getting sick of sleeping in While all my friends are popping pills And I don't think that they're wrong Oh-woah-oh-oh   I think too much, we drink too much Falling apart like it's just nothing I want to know where do we go When nothing's wrong   'Cause all the kids are depressed Nothing ever makes sense I'm not feeling alright Staying up 'til sunrise And hoping shit is okay Pretending we know things I don't know what happened My natural reaction is that we're scared So I guess we're scared   I won't deny it 'cause you saw what it was I can't deny it if you won't give a fuck So I'll sew it up You know I am so in love"
julia,lauv," Can we call it kinda? Yeah When we met That seems really good   When we met, I wasn't me I was so numb, yeah, I was so lonely Out on the run, I wasn't free And you came along, but you couldn't save me   My hesitation and holdin' my breath I led you into the garden of my loneliness Wished that you left before it all burned down   Oh, Julia I'm sorry what I do to ya I push and pull and mess with your head Then get in your bed 'cause I'm weak deep down Oh, Julia I wish I never lied to ya I never meant to hurt you like that And if I could go back, I'd leave you alone   When I left, I wasn't sure That I could love, love anymore   But my hesitation and holdin' my breath I led you into the garden of my loneliness Wished that you left before it all burned down   Oh, Julia I'm sorry what I do to ya I push and pull and mess with your head Then get in your bed 'cause I'm weak deep down Oh, Julia I wish I never lied to ya I never meant to hurt you like that And if I could go back, I'd leave you alone   I won't lie to you no more I won't lie to you no more 'Cause I know I did before Hope you find what you're looking for"
slow,shy martin, I've spent way too much time moving on Tried a couple of therapists Even got rid of some stuff It's like my mind got a mind of its own 'Cause I've been busy getting over Getting over someone   It's not like my brain's not rushing Every time you get too close It's not like I can't imagine Losing myself in your arms It's not like my skin isn't longing After the weight of your touch It's what if I mess this up   So just take it slow 'Cause I'm scared to let go And my heart is struggling not to get hurt again Just take it slow   Someone left me with a broken heart That I passed on to someone And broke a new one apart Things can be good enough Still not enough And that's why I'm terrified Having you by my side   It's not like my brain's not rushing Every time you get too close It's not like I can't imagine Losing myself in your arms It's not like it ain't a habit Thinking 'bout what if too much Like what if I mess this up?   So just take it slow 'Cause I'm scared to let go And my heart is struggling not to get hurt again Just take it slow
your love awakens me,phil wickham,"There were walls between us By the cross, You came and broke them down You broke them down There were chains around us By Your grace, we are no longer bound No longer bound  You called me out of the grave You called me into the light You called my name And then my heart came alive  Your love is greater Your love is stronger Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me Your love is greater Your love is stronger Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me  Feel the darkness shaking All the dead are coming back to life Back to life Hear the song awaken All creation singing we're alive Cause You're alive  What a love we've found Death can't hold us down We shout it out We're alive, ‘cause You're alive"
