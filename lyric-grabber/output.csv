It comes and goes in waves It always does, always does We watch as our young hearts fade Into the flood, into the flood   And the freedom of falling The feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers I'm trying hard to let go It comes and goes in waves It comes and goes in waves And carries us away   Through the wind Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids Memories of a stolen place Caught in the silence, an echo lost in space   It comes and goes in waves It always does, it always does We watch as our young hearts fade Into the flood, into the flood   And the freedom of falling The feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers I'm trying hard to let go It comes and goes in waves It comes and goes in waves And carries us away   I've watched my wild youth Disappear in front of my eyes Moments of magic and wonder It seems so hard to find Is it ever coming back again? Is it ever coming back again? Take me back to the feeling when Everything was left to find   It comes and goes in waves It always does, it always does   And the freedom of falling The feeling I thought was set in stone It slips through my fingers I'm trying hard to let go It comes and goes in waves It comes and goes in waves And carries us away"
