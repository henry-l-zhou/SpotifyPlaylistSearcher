Gaho,시작,새로운 시작은 늘 설레게 하지 모든 걸 이겨낼 것처럼 시간을 뒤쫓는 시계바늘처럼 앞질러 가고 싶어 하지 그어 놓은 선을 넘어 저마다 삶을 향해 때론 원망도 하겠지 그 선을 먼저 넘지 말라고 I can fly the sky Never gonna stay 내가 지쳐 쓰러질 때까진 어떤 이유도 어떤 변명도 지금 내겐 용기가 필요해 빛나지 않아도 내 꿈을 응원해 그 마지막을 가질 테니 부러진 것처럼 한 발로 뛰어도 난 나의 길을 갈 테니까 지금 나를 위한 약속 멈추지 않겠다고 또 하나를 앞지르면 곧 너의 뒤를 따라잡겠지 원하는 대로 다 가질 거야 그게 바로 내 꿈일 테니까 변한 건 없어 버티고 버텨 내 꿈은 더 단단해질 테니 다시 시작해 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah- Ah-ah-ah-ah- 다시는 나를 잃고 싶지 않아 내 전부를 걸었으니까 원하는 대로 다 가질 거야 그게 바로 내 꿈일 테니까 변한 건 없어 버티고 버텨 내 꿈은 더 단단해질 테니 다시 시작해 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah- Ah-ah-ah-ah-

Sondia,Maybe,"This will stay with you for a while now I'm fascinated with the past and what it's done to you  You can call me sentimental if you wanted to And you can call me nieve as I look for truth When you were seven and the bees they had it out for you The air smelled nothing like the city you'd eventually move to  Now what convinced you that you were so deserving When you though god was punishing you? The quiet desperation of your mother in her hearts chamber The simmering, foreclosed exhaustion of your father with his eyes on the weather And if you could forgive yourself as quickly  The world is spinning on a point of soft earth! You can dirty your hands burying a broken heart or so I've heard And if you could stay here my baby We could use you as a sundial and maybe If we collected collective memories Bestow your tribal powers on our budding family"
The VANE,No Break,I'm a schoolboy Foxy girl Break the rules Burn the school No more dances Football games Break the rules Burn the school  Student bodies D.O.A Break the rules Burn the school Fucking jerk Fucking square Break the rules Burn the school  Student bodies D.O.A Break the rules Burn the school No more chances No more games Break the rules Burn the school  Vandalize it Burn it down Burn it Burn it Burn it Burn it Burn that down
The VANE,No Break Instrumental,"For this I was chosen, because I fear nothing With confidence I tread through the dead of the night Off to another war-torn, faraway battlefield Wherein lies a daemonic enemy horde  On this day, I decide to anoint my fists Engaging them in the mode of power and war Stopping at nothing that's short of fulfilling my destiny Willing to die and I will after you for what I believe    Wet with your blood, I sharpen my sword No turning the other cheek like a coward Come tomorrow, I may lay down and die But not this day  Sent on an unholy quest To reduce all those who resist To the size of their shriveled up souls And scatter them like grist  I vanquished the strange holds that the netherworld sets for me The last request of my life is to die killing my enemies    Bathed in blood up to the horse's bridle It's death to retreat, there's no chance of survival    Wet with your blood, I sharpen my sword No turning the other cheek like a coward Come tomorrow, I may lay down and die But not this day  This day we fight! This day we fight!  Strip the fallen heroes Finish off the wounded Collect the spoils of war And send them back dead    This day we fight Fight, fight This day we fight Fight, fight, fight This day I fight"
Crush,No Words,"No words, no words can explain the anger from years and years of being beaten down No words,no words can relay.. no words,no words can erase Brainwashed, domesticated, bound in chains No words, no words can relay  As the giant steamroller called progress mows down the last fragments of what once was  No words can explain the rage as another factory replaces another field No words, no words can relay  No words can begin to say what would be said if the dead could replay, if the napalmed children, the tortured dissidents, the publicly executed, the burned villages, the silent masses could cry, could scream, could speak..  Telling tales of tragedies for which we find no words For which there are no words"
V,Sweet Night," On my pillow Can't get me tired Sharing my fragile truth That I still hope the door is open ’Cause the window Opened one time with you and me Now my forever's falling down Wondering if you'd want me now   How could I know One day, I’d wake up feeling more But I had already reached the shore Guess we were ships in the night, night, night Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah We were ships in the night, night, night   I'm wondering, are you my best friend? Feels like a river's rushing through my mind I wanna ask you if this is all just in my head My heart is pounding tonight, I wonder If you are too good to be true And would it be alright if I Pulled you closer   How could I know One day, I'd wake up feeling more But I had already reached the shore Guess we were ships in the night, night, night Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah We were ships in the night, night, night"
