all the kids are depressed,jeremy zucker,"[u""\n\r\nHow long have you been smiling?\nIt seems like it's been too long\nSome days I don't feel like trying\nSo what the fuck are you on?\n\nI think too much, we drink too much\nFalling in love like it's just nothing\nI want to know where do we go\nWhen nothing's wrong\n\n'Cause all the kids are depressed\nNothing ever makes sense\nI'm not feeling alright\nStaying up 'til sunrise\nAnd hoping shit is okay\nPretending we know things\nI don't know what happened\nMy natural reaction is that we're scared\nSo I guess we're scared\n\nBut I can't really keep lying\n'Cause I've been scared all along\nGetting sick of sleeping in\nWhile all my friends are popping pills\nAnd I don't think that they're wrong\n\nI think too much, we drink too much\nFalling apart like it's just nothing\nI want to know where do we go\nWhen nothing's wrong\n\n'Cause all the kids are depressed\nNothing ever makes sense\nI'm not feeling alright\nStaying up 'til sunrise\nAnd hoping shit is okay\nPretending we know things\nI don't know what happened\nMy natural reaction is that we're scared\nSo I guess we're scared\n\nI won't deny it 'cause you saw what it was\nI can't deny it if you won't give a fuck\nSo I'll start it out\nYou know I am so in love\n""]"
julia,lauv,"[u""\n\r\n- My colleague, kinda\n- Yeah\n(When we met)\n- That seems right, yeah\n\nWhen we met\n\nWhen we met\nI wasn't me\nI was so numb\nYeah, I was so lonely\n\nOut on the run\nI wasn't free\nAnd you came along\nBut you couldn't save me\n\nMy hesitation and holding my breath\nI led you in to the garden of my loneliness\nWish that you left\nBefore it all burned down\n\nOh, Julia\nI'm sorry what I do to you\nI push and pull and mess with your head\nThen get in your bed 'cause I'm weak, deep down\n\nOh, Julia\nI wish I never lied to you\nI never meant to hurt you like that\nAnd if I could go back I'd leave you alone\n\nWhen I left\nI wasn't sure\nThat I could love\nLove anymore\n\nBut my hesitation and holding my breath\nI led you in to the garden of my loneliness\nWish that you left\nBefore it all burned down\n\nOh, Julia\nI'm sorry what I do to you\nI push and pull and mess with your head\nThen get in your bed 'cause I'm weak, deep down\n\nOh, Julia\nI wish I never lied to you\nI never meant to hurt you like that\nAnd if I could go back I'd leave you alone\n\nI won't lie to you no more\nI won't lie to you no more\n'Cause I know I did before\nHope you find what you looking for\n""]"
slow,shy martin,"[u'\n\r\nI\'ve spent way too much time moving on\nTried a couple of therapists\nEven got rid off some stuff\nIt\'s like my mind got a mind of its own\n\'Cause I\'ve been busy getting over\nGetting over someone\n\nIt\'s not like my brain\'s not in a rush and every time you get too close\nIt\'s not like I can\'t imagine losing myself in your arms\nIt\'s not like my skin isn\'t longing after the weight of your touch\nIt\'s what if I mess this up\n\nSo just take it slow\n\'Cause I\'m scare to let go\nAnd my heart is struggling\nNot to get hurt again\nJust take it slow\n\nSo I left me with a broken heart\nThat I\'ve passed on to someone\nAnd broke a new one apart\nThings can be good and I\'m still not here enough\nAnd that\'s why I\'m terrified\nHaving you by my side\n\nIt\'s not like my brain\'s not in a rush and every time you get too close\nIt\'s not like I can\'t imagine losing myself in your arms\nIt\'s not like it ain\'t a habit thinking ""But what if?"" too much\nLike what if I mess this up?\n\nSo just take it slow\n\'Cause I\'m scare to let go\nAnd my heart is struggling\nNot to get hurt again\nJust take it slow\n']"
your love awakens me,phil wickham,"[u""\n\r\nThere were walls between us\nBy the cross you came\nAnd broke them down\nYou broke them down\nThere were chains around us\nBy Your grace we are\nNo longer bound\nNo longer bound\n\nYou called me out of the grave\nYou called me into the light\nYou called my name and then my heart came alive\n\nYour love is greater\nYour love is stronger\nYour love awakens\nAwakens\nAwakens me\n[x2]\n\nFeel the darkness shaking\nAll the dead are coming\nBack to life\nBack to life\nHear the song awaken\nAll creation singing\nWe're alive\nCause You're alive\n\nYou called me out of the grave\nYou called me into the light\nYou called my name and then my heart came alive\n\nYour love is greater\nYour love is stronger\nYour love awakens\nAwakens\nAwakens me\n[x2]\n\nWhat a love we found\nDeath can't hold us down\nWe shout it out\nWe're alive\nCause you're alive\n[x3]\n\nYour love is greater\nYour love is stronger\nYour love awakens\nAwakens\nAwakens me\n[x4]\n\nYour love awakens me\n\nYour love is greater\nYour love is stronger\nYour love awakens\nAwakens\nAwakens me\n""]"
